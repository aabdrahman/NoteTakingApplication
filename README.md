# NoteTakingApplication

The Note Taking Application is a C# console Application embedded with the functionality of registering users by using the desired username to create a unique 6 digits number as the user login details which will be required by users to login the profile. The user can create note, edit an already created note, delete note and logout of profile when on the user menu. The notes are created by creating a json file in the specified folder for Users and saved with the unique ID of the user. A single json file is used to hold all the notes created by the user in a list which is fetched upon login and displayed to the user to either edit or delete in the user menu.

This is practically a personal project that employs the basic fundamentals of C# like Classes, user input, Reading and writing to console, error and exception handling, Reading and Writing fro/to a json file.

Feel free to engage for further enhancement.
